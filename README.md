# Rivet Chat app - Server

## Description 
In case of a future apocalypse, or just loneliness, there will be a dire need to stay connected through a digital platform. Rivet is a real-time chatting application to stay connected with friends, family, and co-workers with competitive features and pricing. We solved this problem by building an chat app that utilizes socket.io to create real time connections with a cool, retro, frog centered theme.
